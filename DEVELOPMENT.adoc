[[development--versioning]]
=== 📦 Versioning

Versions are defined using https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging[Tags],
which in turn are https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/version.html[recognized and used] by Ansible Galaxy.

When a new tag is pushed, https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release-to-galaxy.yml[
a GitHub CI workflow] takes care of importing the role to my Ansible Galaxy Account.

=== 🧃 Ideal, Containerized Development Environments

This Project offers definitions for 1-Click Containerized Development Environments through

* https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers[
  Visual Studio Development Containers] (Local Docker Installation needed)
* https://www.gitpod.io/[Gitpod] (Cloud-Native Visual Studio Code PaaS)

These Containers even allow one to run docker containers inside of them (Docker-In-Docker, dind),
allowing for molecule execution.

[NOTE]
=====
You absolutely do not need to use it.
Your development environment can be whatever you want.

You don't even need to run tests on your local machine.
This Project uses the magic of CI/CD to automatically check your contributions' validness
(linting, most formatting, tests).
=====

==== Local Containerized Development Environment

The _Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers_ extension lets one use a Docker container
as a full-featured development environment.

This Project offers such a devcontainer definition.
By looking at its docker-compose and dockerfile definition,
one may inform himself about everything there is to know about
how to setup the ideal development environment,
*even if you do not use this editor in combination with this feature*
(Code as Documentation).

To use it:

1. Install https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code].
2. Click on the following badge (which is even linked at the top of most of my projects) and press "Clone repo in container volume": https://open.vscode.dev/jonaspammer/ansible-role-bootstrap[image:https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=visualstudiocode&label=&message=Open%20in%20Visual%20Studio%20Code&labelColor=2c2c32&color=007acc&logoColor=007acc[Open in Visual Studio Code]]

[NOTE]
=====
You may need to...

* Install and configure https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker] for your operating system.


* Install the https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension[Remote Development extension pack.]

, even though modern VSCode offers to automatically do all that too
by just clicking a button that pops up (crazy).
=====

[NOTE]
=====
You may need to configure your host system to enable the container to use your SSH Keys.

The procedure is described https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container[
in the official devcontainer docs under "Sharing Git credentials with your container"].
=====

[TIP]
====
The "Open in Visual Studio Code" badge even got other fancy options worth checking out, especially for non-relevant Ad-Hoc On-The-Go changes, being
"Open with Remote Repositories" or
"Open in VS Code for the Web".
====

[TIP]
====
Once you've opened a folder in a container, any terminal window you open in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal) will automatically run in the container rather than locally.
====

==== Gitpod Containerized Development Environment

__It's basically like what you would get by clicking on "Open in VS Code for the Web",
with the exception that there's an actual machine running docker somewhere for you,
so you basically got *all* the features --
but also with all the benefits of a pre-defined, Containerized Development Environment.
It even has a free plan.
It's great for Ad-Hoc changes / fiddling around from anywhere on any kind of Computer Device I'm on right now.
Big Baller's can even Self-Host the service.__
