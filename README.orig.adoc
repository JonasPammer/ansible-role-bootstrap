An Ansible role for preparing a linux system to be managed by ansible.

This role uses the raw module (in combination with its own os-determination-system)
to install the minimum required set of packages (python and sudo) to allow Ansible to manage a system.

This role also ensures an up-to-date package cache for most systems.

In most cases, you will want to use this role in combination with my
https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-core_dependencies[`core_dependencies`-role].

[[meta]]
== üîé Metadata
Below you can find information on‚Ä¶

* the role's required Ansible version
* the role's supported platforms
* the role's https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies[role dependencies]

[[requirements]]
== üìå Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.

[[variables]]
== üìú Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_user: root
----
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/special_variables.html#term-ansible_user[Username]
used to connect to the machine for the primary `raw` tasks of _gathering simple facts_ / _installing_.

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_become: false
bootstrap_become_user: root
----
`become` and `become_user` variables passed to most actual tasks.

The default value of `bootstrap_become` was set to `false`
because of the assumption that `sudo` is not available
before bootstrapping.

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_wait_for_host: false
----
Whether to wait for the host to be available on `ansible_port` (22).

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_timeout: 3
----
Maximum number of seconds to wait for the remote system to be reachable/usable before failing.


[[public_vars]]
== üìú Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section
is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) _and_
is meant to be used not just internally.


[[tags]]
== üè∑Ô∏è Tags

// Checkout https://github.com/tribe29/ansible-collection-tribe29.checkmk/blob/main/roles/server/README.md#tags
// for an awesome example of grouping tasks using tags

Tasks are tagged with the following
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html#adding-tags-to-roles[tags]:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Tag | Purpose

2+| This role does not have officially documented tags yet.

// | download-xyz
// |
// | install-prerequisites
// |
// | install
// |
// | create-xyz
// |
|===

You can use Ansible to skip tasks, or only run certain tasks by using these tags. By default, all tasks are run when no tags are specified.

[[dependencies]]
== üë´ Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.


[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users too:

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must disable the `gather_facts`-property of the play this role is used in.
If this role finished successfully it'll call https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html[
ansible's setup module] itself (equivalent effect that `gather_facts: true` would give).

No tasks must come before this role.
