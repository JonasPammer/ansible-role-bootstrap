An Ansible role for preparing a linux system to be managed by ansible.

This role uses the raw module (in combination with its own os-determination-system)
to install the minimum required set of packages (python and sudo) to allow Ansible to manage a system.

In most cases, you want to use this role in combination with the `ansible-core_dependencies`-role.

[NOTE]
====
You must disable the `gather_facts`-property of the play this role is used in.
If this role finished successfully it'll call https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html[
ansible's setup module] itself (equivalent effect that `gather_facts: true` would give).

No tasks must come before this role.

[[development::versioning]]
=== ðŸ“¦ Versioning

Versions are defined using https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging[Tags],
which in turn get https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/version.html[recognized and used] by Ansible Galaxy.

When a new tag is pushed, https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release.yml[
a GitHub CI workflow] takes care of importing the role to my Ansible Galaxy Account.

There is no _variable_ that denotes the "version" of the current directory/role.
Just look-into (and maintain) `link:CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG.adoc]`.

=== ðŸ§ƒ Visual Studio Code Development Container

The Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment.

This Project offers such a devcontainer definition.
By looking at its docker-compose and dockerfile definition,
one can inform himself about everything there is to know about
how to setup the required / recommended development environment,
*even if you do not use this editor in combination with this feature*.



To use it:

1. Install and configure https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker] for your operating system.
2. Install https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]
3. Install the https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension[Remote Development extension pack.]
4. Issue the VS Code command `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` (e.g. by pressing F1, *or* clicking on the icon found on the most left in the lower status bar) to activate the environment.
