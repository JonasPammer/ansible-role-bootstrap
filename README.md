An Ansible role for preparing a linux system to be managed by ansible.

This role uses the raw module (in combination with its own
os-determination-system) to install the minimum required set of packages
(python and sudo) to allow Ansible to manage a system.

In most cases, you want to use this role in combination with the
`ansible-core_dependencies`-role.

üí™ Development
=============

üì¶ Versioning
------------

Versions are defined using
[Tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging), which in turn
are [recognized and
used](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/version.html) by
Ansible Galaxy.

When a new tag is pushed, [a GitHub CI
workflow](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release.yml)
takes care of importing the role to my Ansible Galaxy Account. ![Release
CI](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

üßÉ Recommended Development Environment [![]()](https://open.vscode.dev/jonaspammer/ansible-role-bootstrap)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers* extension lets one use a
Docker container as a full-featured development environment.

This Project offers such a devcontainer definition. By looking at its
docker-compose and dockerfile definition, one can inform himself about
everything there is to know about how to setup the required /
recommended development environment, **even if you do not use this
editor in combination with this feature**.

To use it:

1.  Install and configure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
    for your operating system.

2.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3.  Install the [Remote Development extension
    pack.](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension)

4.  Issue the VS Code command `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`
    (e.g. by pressing F1, **or** clicking on the icon found on the most
    left in the lower status bar) to activate the environment.

    ![remote containers
    reopen](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/remote/containers/remote-containers-reopen.png)

5.  You may need to configure your host system to enable the container
    to use your SSH Keys. The procedure is described [in the official
    devcontainer docs under "Sharing Git credentials with your
    container"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container).

Once you‚Äôve opened a folder in a container, any terminal window you open
in VS Code (Terminal &gt; New Terminal) will automatically run in the
container rather than locally.

üíÅ Tips
------

Take a look at my general ansible role development guidelines at .

üç™ CookieCutter
--------------

This Project shall be kept in sync with [the CookieCutter it was
originally templated
from](https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role) using
[cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) (if possible) or manual
alteration (if needed) to the best extend possible.

üí™ Contributing
==============

Preamble
--------

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this Project.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the
time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your
issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

üí¨ Conventional Commits
----------------------

A casual contributor does not have to worry about following [*the
spec*](https://gist.github.com/JonasPammer/4ea577854ae10afe644bff366d7b2a8a)
[*by definition*](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), as
pull requests are being squash merged into one commit in the project.
Only core contributors, i.e. those with rights to push to this project‚Äôs
branches, must follow it (e.g. to allow for automatic version
determination and changelog generation to work).

üö® **However, you still need to make sure that you create small,
self-contained commits and pull requests.** *More on this general
concept may be found in in the following sections and the blogs linked
in it.*

üöÄ Getting Started
-----------------

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).
A few general guidelines that cover both:

-   Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

-   If you‚Äôve never contributed before, see [the first timer‚Äôs guide on
    Auth0‚Äôs
    blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/)
    for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to
discuss potential changes **before** a PR is created. When you [create a
new
Issue](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/issues/new),
a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and
providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you‚Äôre having, please
add your own reproduction information to the existing issue **rather
than creating a new one**. Adding a
[reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem
is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to this Project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get
your fix or improvement slated for the next release. [In
general](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/),
PRs should:

-   Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address
    wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.

-   Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if
    a test suite already exists).

-   **Address a single concern**

-   **Include documentation** in the repo

-   Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded
    automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking
changes (e.g. a major release), it‚Äôs best to open an Issue to discuss
your proposal first.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow

1.  Fork the repository to your own Github account

2.  Clone the project to your machine

3.  Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name

4.  Commit changes to the branch

5.  Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this
    repo

6.  Push changes to your fork

7.  Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we
    can efficiently review the changes.
