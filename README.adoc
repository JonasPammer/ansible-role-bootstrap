An Ansible role for preparing a linux system to be managed by ansible.

This role uses the raw module (in combination with its own os-determination-system)
to install the minimum required set of packages (python and sudo) to allow Ansible to manage a system.

In most cases, you want to use this role in combination with the `ansible-core_dependencies`-role.

[[requirements]]
== 📌 Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
User needs to be able to `become`



[[variables]]
== 📜 Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.

[source,yaml]

bootstrap_user: root
----
Username used to connect to the machine.

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_wait_for_host: false
----
Whether to wait for the host to be available on `ansible_port` (22).

[[example_playbooks]]
== 📚 Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users too:

[NOTE]
====
You must disable the `gather_facts`-property of the play this role is used in.
If this role finished successfully it'll call https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html[
ansible's setup module] itself (equivalent effect that `gather_facts: true` would give).

No tasks must come before this role.

[[development--versioning]]
=== 📦 Versioning

Versions are defined using https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging[Tags],
which in turn are https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/version.html[recognized and used] by Ansible Galaxy.

When a new tag is pushed, https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release.yml[
a GitHub CI workflow] takes care of importing the role to my Ansible Galaxy Account.

[[development--environment]]
=== 🧃 Recommended Development Environment https://open.vscode.dev/jonaspammer/ansible-role-bootstrap[image:https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg[Open in Visual Studio Code]]

The _Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers_ extension lets one use a Docker container
as a full-featured development environment.

This Project offers such a devcontainer definition.
By looking at its docker-compose and dockerfile definition,
one can inform himself about everything there is to know about
how to setup the required / recommended development environment,
*even if you do not use this editor in combination with this feature*.

To use it:

1. Install and configure https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker] for your operating system.
2. Install https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]
3. Install the https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension[Remote Development extension pack.]
4. Issue the VS Code command `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` (e.g. by pressing F1, *or* clicking on the icon found on the most left in the lower status bar) to activate the environment.
+
image:https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/remote/containers/remote-containers-reopen.png[]
5. You may need to configure your host system to enable the container to use your SSH Keys.
   The procedure is described https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container[in the official devcontainer docs under "Sharing Git credentials with your container"].

Once you've opened a folder in a container, any terminal window you open in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal) will automatically run in the container rather than locally.
