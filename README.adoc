An Ansible role for preparing a linux system to be managed by ansible.

This role uses the raw module (in combination with its own os-determination-system)
to install the minimum required set of packages (python and sudo) to allow Ansible to manage a system.

In most cases, you will want to use this role in combination with my
https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-core_dependencies[`core_dependencies`-role].

Below you can find information on‚Ä¶

* the role's required Ansible version
* the role's supported platforms
* the role's https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies[role dependencies]

[[requirements]]
== üìå Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.

The https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general[`community.general` collection]
must be installed on the Ansible controller.

[[variables]]
== üìú Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_user: root
----
Username used to connect to the machine.

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_wait_for_host: false
----
Whether to wait for the host to be available on `ansible_port` (22).

[source,yaml]
----
bootstrap_timeout: 3
----
Maximum number of seconds to wait for the remote system to be reachable/usable before failing.


[[public_vars]]
== üìú Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section
is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) _and_
is meant to be used not just internally.


[[dependencies]]
== üë´ Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.


[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users too:

[NOTE]
====
This role is part of https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-roles[
many compatible purpose-specific roles of mine].

The machine needs to be prepared.
In CI, this is done in `molecule/default/prepare.yml`
which sources its soft dependencies from `requirements.yml`:

The following diagram is a compilation of the "soft dependencies" of this role
as well as the recursive tree of their soft dependencies.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must disable the `gather_facts`-property of the play this role is used in.
If this role finished successfully it'll call https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html[
ansible's setup module] itself (equivalent effect that `gather_facts: true` would give).

No tasks must come before this role.
