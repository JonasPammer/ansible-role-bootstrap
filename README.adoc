An Ansible role for preparing a linux system to be managed by ansible.

This role uses the raw module (in combination with its own os-determination-system)
to install the minimum required set of packages (python and sudo) to allow Ansible to manage a system.

In most cases, you want to use this role in combination with the `ansible-core_dependencies`-role.

[[requirements]]
== üìå Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
User needs to be able to `become`



[[variables]]
== üìú Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.

[source,yaml]

bootstrap_user: root
----
Username used to connect to the machine.

[source,yaml]

Whether to wait for the host to be available on `ansible_port` (22).

[source,yaml]

Maximum number of seconds to wait for the remote system to be reachable/usable before failing.


[[dependencies]]

[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users too:

[NOTE]
====
You must disable the `gather_facts`-property of the play this role is used in.
If this role finished successfully it'll call https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html[
ansible's setup module] itself (equivalent effect that `gather_facts: true` would give).

No tasks must come before this role.

[[development--versioning]]
=== üì¶ Versioning

Versions are defined using https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging[Tags],
which in turn are https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/version.html[recognized and used] by Ansible Galaxy.

When a new tag is pushed, https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release.yml[
a GitHub CI workflow] takes care of importing the role to my Ansible Galaxy Account.

[[development--environment]]
=== üßÉ Recommended Development Environment https://open.vscode.dev/jonaspammer/ansible-role-bootstrap[image:https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg[Open in Visual Studio Code]]

The _Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers_ extension lets one use a Docker container
as a full-featured development environment.

This Project offers such a devcontainer definition.
By looking at its docker-compose and dockerfile definition,
one can inform himself about everything there is to know about
how to setup the required / recommended development environment,
*even if you do not use this editor in combination with this feature*.

To use it:

1. Install and configure https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker] for your operating system.
2. Install https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]
3. Install the https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension[Remote Development extension pack.]
4. Issue the VS Code command `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` (e.g. by pressing F1, *or* clicking on the icon found on the most left in the lower status bar) to activate the environment.

== üí™ Contributing
First off, thank you for considering contributing to this Project.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

=== üí¨ Conventional Commits

This Project enforces rules over how the git commit messages can be formatted.
This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.
But also, this project use the git commit messages to generate the change log.

**Though** it makes the life of the Git lead easier**, not every casual contributor has to strictly follow it**,
as a squash merge allows the Git lead to clean up the commit messages.
**Just make sure to make small, self-enclosed commits.**

https://gist.github.com/JonasPammer/4ea577854ae10afe644bff366d7b2a8a[*This gist* of mine]
gives a quick overview of everything to know about Conventional Commits as a Contributor.

=== üöÄ Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).
A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* If you've never contributed before, see https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/[
  the first timer's guide on Auth0's blog] for resources and tips on how to get started.

==== Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes *before* a PR is created.
When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having,
please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue *rather than creating a new one*.
Adding a https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/[reaction]
can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

==== Pull Requests

PRs to this Project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release.
In general, PRs should:

* Only fix/add the functionality in question *OR* address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
* *Address a single concern*
* *Include documentation* in the repo
* Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release),
it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
