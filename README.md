[![Version on Galaxy](https://img.shields.io/badge/available%20on%20ansible%20galaxy-jonaspammer.bootstrap-brightgreen)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/jonaspammer/bootstrap) [![Testing CI](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An Ansible role for preparing a linux system to be managed by ansible.

This role uses the [`ansible.builtin.raw` module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.16/collections/ansible/builtin/raw_module.html) in combination with an own-implemented "Operating System determination system" to install the minimum required set of packages (`python` and `sudo`) in order to allow Ansible to manage a system.

This role also ensures an up-to-date package cache for most systems.

In most cases, you will want to use this role in combination with my [`core_dependencies`-role](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-core_dependencies).

DISCLAIMER

This role is a fork of [robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap v7.0.3 (19 September, 2024)](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/releases/tag/7.0.3) (Apache License 2.0, Copyright Robert de Bock (<robert@meinit.nl>)) that has the intent to implement fixes for the issues mentioned below (excerpt from [/releases](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/releases) with accompanying Issues in robertdebock‚Äôs repository):

-   use `bootstrap_become_user` in ansible modules steps too ([robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap#59](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/issues/59))

-   change default of become to `false`, add ability to define `become_user` seperately from `ansible_user`: [robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap#63](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/issues/63) ( fixed in [JonasPammer#61](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/pull/61) )

-   change default of `bootstrap_become_user` to root

-   The role itself should pre-heat the the package manager cache: [robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap#57](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/pull/57) ( fixed in [JonasPammer#43](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/pull/43); [JonasPammer#50](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/pull/50) )  
    Update: The mentioned upstream PR was merged on Dec 4, 2024 in [robertdebock/6.2.4](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/releases/tag/6.2.4)

-   make role compatible with podman by specifying `/bin/sh` [robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap#55](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/issues/55) [robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap#66](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/pull/66) ( fixed in [JonasPammer#62](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/pull/62) )  
    Update: The mentioned upstream issue was fixed alternative way on Aug 24, 2023 in [robertdebock/6.1.10](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/releases/tag/6.1.10)

# üìå Requirements

The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.

# üìú Role Variables

    bootstrap_user: root

[Username](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/special_variables.html#term-ansible_user) used to connect to the machine for the primary `raw` tasks of *gathering simple facts* / *installing*.

    bootstrap_become: false
    bootstrap_become_user: root

`become` and `become_user` variables passed to most actual tasks.

The default value of `bootstrap_become` was set to `false` because of the assumption that `sudo` is not available before bootstrapping.

    bootstrap_wait_for_host: false

Whether to wait for the host to be available on `ansible_port` (22).

    bootstrap_timeout: 3

Maximum number of seconds to wait for the remote system to be reachable/usable before failing.

# üìú Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) *and* is meant to be used not just internally.

# üè∑Ô∏è Tags

Tasks are tagged with the following [tags](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html#adding-tags-to-roles):

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" style="text-align: left;"><p>This role does not have officially documented tags yet.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can use Ansible to skip tasks, or only run certain tasks by using these tags. By default, all tasks are run when no tags are specified.

# üë´ Dependencies

# üìö Example Playbook Usages

You must disable the `gather_facts`-property of the play this role is used in. If this role finished successfully it‚Äôll call [ ansible‚Äôs setup module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html) itself (equivalent effect that `gather_facts: true` would give).

No tasks must come before this role.

# üß™ Tested Ansible versions

The tested ansible versions try to stay equivalent with the [ support pattern of Ansible‚Äôs `community.general` collection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general#tested-with-ansible). As of writing this is:

-   2.13 (Ansible 6)

-   2.14 (Ansible 7)

-   2.15 (Ansible 8)

-   2.16 (Ansible 9)

# üìù Development

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org) [![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/master.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/master)

## üìå Development Machine Dependencies

-   Python 3.10 or greater

-   Docker

## üìå Development Dependencies

Development Dependencies are defined in a [pip requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) named `requirements-dev.txt`. Example Installation Instructions for Linux are shown below:

    # "optional": create a python virtualenv and activate it for the current shell session
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate

    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ansible Role Development Guidelines

Please take a look at my [ Ansible Role Development Guidelines](https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role/blob/master/ROLE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.adoc).

If interested, I‚Äôve also written down some [ General Ansible Role Development (Best) Practices](https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role/blob/master/ROLE_DEVELOPMENT_TIPS.adoc).

## üî¢ Versioning

Versions are defined using [Tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging), which in turn are [recognized and used](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/version.html) by Ansible Galaxy.

**Versions must not start with `v`.**

When a new tag is pushed, [ a GitHub CI workflow](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release-to-galaxy.yml) (![Release CI](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/actions/workflows/release-to-galaxy.yml/badge.svg)) takes care of importing the role to my Ansible Galaxy Account.

## üß™ Testing

Automatic Tests are run on each Contribution using GitHub Workflows.

The Tests primarily resolve around running [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on a [varying set of linux distributions](#tested-distributions) and using [various ansible versions](#tested-ansible-versions).

The molecule test also includes a step which lints all ansible playbooks using [`ansible-lint`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint#readme) to check for best practices and behaviour that could potentially be improved.

To run the tests, simply run `tox` on the command line. You can pass an optional environment variable to define the distribution of the Docker container that will be spun up by molecule:

    $ MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu2204 tox

For a list of possible values fed to `MOLECULE_DISTRO`, take a look at the matrix defined in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

### üêõ Debugging a Molecule Container

1.  Run your molecule tests with the option `MOLECULE_DESTROY=never`, e.g.:

        $ MOLECULE_DESTROY=never MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu1604 tox -e py3-ansible-5
        ...
          TASK [ansible-role-pip : (redacted).] ************************
          failed: [instance-py3-ansible-9] => changed=false
        ...
         ___________________________________ summary ____________________________________
          pre-commit: commands succeeded
        ERROR:   py3-ansible-9: commands failed

2.  Find out the name of the molecule-provisioned docker container:

        $ docker ps
        30e9b8d59cdf   geerlingguy/docker-debian12-ansible:latest   "/lib/systemd/systemd"   8 minutes ago   Up 8 minutes                                                                                                    instance-py3-ansible-9

3.  Get into a bash Shell of the container, and do your debugging:

        $ docker exec -it 30e9b8d59cdf /bin/bash

        root@instance-py3-ansible-2:/#

    If the failure you try to debug is part of your `verify.yml` step and not the actual `converge.yml`, you may want to know that the output of ansible‚Äôs modules (`vars`), hosts (`hostvars`) and environment variables have been stored into files on both the provisioner and inside the docker machine under:

    -   `/var/tmp/vars.yml` (contains host variables under the `hostvars` key)

    -   `/var/tmp/environment.yml`

    `grep`, `cat` or transfer these as you wish!

    You may also want to know that the files mentioned in the admonition above are attached to the **GitHub CI Artifacts** of a given Workflow run.  
    This allows one to check the difference between runs and thus help in debugging what caused the bit-rot or failure in general.

    <figure>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32995541/178442403-e15264ca-433a-4bc7-95db-cfadb573db3c.png" alt="178442403 e15264ca 433a 4bc7 95db cfadb573db3c" />
    </figure>

4.  After you finished your debugging, exit it and destroy the container:

        root@instance-py3-ansible-2:/# exit

        $ docker stop 30e9b8d59cdf

        $ docker container rm 30e9b8d59cdf
        or
        $ docker container prune

### üêõ Debugging installed package versions locally

Although a standard feature in tox 3, this [now](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/pull/2794) only happens when tox recognizes the presence of a CI variable. For example:

    $ CI=true tox

## üßÉ TIP: Containerized Ideal Development Environment

This Project offers a definition for a "1-Click Containerized Development Environment".

This Container even enables one to run docker containers inside of it (Docker-In-Docker, dind), allowing for molecule execution.

To use it:

1.  Ensure you fullfill the [ the System requirements of Visual Studio Code Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements), optionally following the *Installation*-Section of the linked page section.  
    This includes: Installing Docker, Installing Visual Studio Code itself, and Installing the necessary Extension.

2.  Clone the project to your machine

3.  Open the folder of the repo in Visual Studio Code (*File - Open Folder‚Ä¶*).

4.  If you get a prompt at the lower right corner informing you about the presence of the devcontainer definition, you can press the accompanying button to enter it. **Otherwise,** you can also execute the Visual Studio Command `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container` yourself (*View - Command Palette* ‚Üí *type in the mentioned command*).

I recommend using `Remote-Containers: Rebuild Without Cache and Reopen in Container` once here and there as the devcontainer feature does have some problems recognizing changes made to its definition properly some times.

You may need to configure your host system to enable the container to use your SSH/GPG Keys.

The procedure is described [ in the official devcontainer docs under "Sharing Git credentials with your container"](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials).

## üç™ CookieCutter

This Project shall be kept in sync with [the CookieCutter it was originally templated from](https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role) using [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) (if possible) or manual alteration (if needed) to the best extend possible.

> </figure>

### üïó Changelog

When a new tag is pushed, an appropriate GitHub Release will be created by the Repository Maintainer to provide a proper human change log with a title and description.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Linting and Styling Conventions

General Linting and Styling Conventions are [**automatically** held up to Standards](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/20/linters-arent-in-your-way-theyre-on-your-side/) by various [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks, at least to some extend.

Automatic Execution of pre-commit is done on each Contribution using [`pre-commit.ci`](https://pre-commit.ci/)[\*](#note_pre-commit-ci). Pull Requests even automatically get fixed by the same tool, at least by hooks that automatically alter files.

Not to confuse: Although some pre-commit hooks may be able to warn you about script-analyzed flaws in syntax or even code to some extend (for which reason pre-commit‚Äôs hooks are **part of** the test suite), pre-commit itself does not run any real Test Suites. For Information on Testing, see [üß™ Testing](#testing).

Nevertheless, I recommend you to integrate pre-commit into your local development workflow yourself.

This can be done by cd‚Äôing into the directory of your cloned project and running `pre-commit install`. Doing so will make git run pre-commit checks on every commit you make, aborting the commit themselves if a hook alarm‚Äôed.

You can also, for example, execute pre-commit‚Äôs hooks at any time by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.

# üí™ Contributing

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=visualstudiocode&label=&message=Open%20in%20Visual%20Studio%20Code&labelColor=2c2c32&color=007acc&logoColor=007acc)](https://open.vscode.dev/jonaspammer/ansible-role-bootstrap) ![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

The following sections are generic in nature and are used to help new contributors. The actual "Development Documentation" of this project is found under [üìù Development](#development).

## Preamble

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this Project.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## üç™ CookieCutter

This Project owns many of its files to [the CookieCutter it was originally templated from](https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role).

Please check if the edit you have in mind is actually applicable to the template and if so make an appropriate change there instead. Your change may also be applicable partly to the template as well as partly to something specific to this project, in which case you would be creating multiple PRs.

## üí¨ Conventional Commits

A casual contributor does not have to worry about following [*the spec*](https://github.com/JonasPammer/JonasPammer/blob/master/demystifying/conventional_commits.adoc) [*by definition*](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), as pull requests are being squash merged into one commit in the project. Only core contributors, i.e. those with rights to push to this project‚Äôs branches, must follow it (e.g. to allow for automatic version determination and changelog generation to work).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

-   Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

-   If you‚Äôve never contributed before, see [ the first timer‚Äôs guide on Auth0‚Äôs blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes **before** a PR is created. When you [ create a new Issue](https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap/issues/new), a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you‚Äôre having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue **rather than creating a new one**. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to this Project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. [In general](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/), PRs should:

-   Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.

-   Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).

-   **Address a single concern**

-   **Include documentation** in the repo

-   Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it‚Äôs best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow

1.  Fork the repository to your own Github account

2.  Clone the project to your machine

3.  Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name

4.  Commit changes to the branch

5.  Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo

6.  Push changes to your fork

7.  Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
